# My Personal Nuxt Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)! It is a static site designed to highlight my skills, projects and previous work.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies (I recommend `yarn`):

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Generate static build of the application for production:

```bash
yarn generate
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npx serve .output/public
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
